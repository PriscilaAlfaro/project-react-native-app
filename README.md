# Week 16 - Technigo Bootcamp

# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This week we will test out some React Native and build our first mobile app.

## The problem

This week I decided to go for a project that includes the use of the accelerometer to show some information. I created a game similar to 8 magic ball but inspired by the movie "Big" where appears the machine Zoltar. 
So the app, has three pages, the home where you can tab a button to start asking your questions, the sensor page, where the user shakes the phone and find an answer, and the third page for inspirational questions for Zoltar. 
I started with the design which was a mistake because when I applied the navigation all the designs look completely different. Lesson learned!
I fetch info from a free API called [delegator](https://8ball.delegator.com/) which provides random answers in the classic structure of positive, negative, and neutral. 
I used Expo to build the app for android and ios, so it was necessary to install all the dependencies related with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) to develop the project. 
As part of the project also was necessary to use [navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/) from react, to navigate between the pages. 
At the end I applied fonts using an [article](https://blog.jsdisco.dev/using-custom-fonts-with-expo) about the topic.
I can say that was a very interesting experience to start knowing about [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).
